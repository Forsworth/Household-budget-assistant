# Household-budget-assistant
.Net framework 4.5 WPF C# Application

This is a .Net Framework 4.5 app that was developed as a budget assistant.
It can read xml, xls, xlsx files and save xml. The app also calculates balance and saldo.
This project is open-source and uses third-party libraries.
Copying, modifying is not prohibited, though I would appreciate it if you mention me among the developers, should you ever use it
in your projects.
